# Implement dependency management (5-10%)

## Design a dependency management strategy

recommend artifact management tools and practices (Azure Artifacts, npm, maven, Nuget)
abstract common packages to enable sharing and reuse
inspect codebase to identify code dependencies that can be converted to packages
identify and recommend standardized package types and versions across the solution
refactor existing build pipelines to implement version strategy that publishes packages

## Manage security and compliance

inspect open source software packages for security and license compliance to align with corporate standards (e.g. GPLv3)
configure build pipeline to access package security and license rating (e.g. Black Duck, White Source)
configure secure access to package feeds
