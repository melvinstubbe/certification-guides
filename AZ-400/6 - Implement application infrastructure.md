# Implement application infrastructure (15-20%)

## Design an infrastructure and configuration management strategy

- analyze existing and future hosting infrastructure
- analyze existing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies
- design a strategy for managing technical debt on templates
- design a strategy for using transient infrastructure for parts of a delivery lifecycle
- design a strategy to mitigate infrastructure state drift

## Implement infrastructure as code (IaC)

- create nested resource templates
- manage secrets in resource templates
- provision Azure resources
- recommend an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) strategy
- recommend appropriate technologies for configuration management (ARM Templates, Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Ansible)

## Manage Azure Kubernetes Service infrastructure

- provision Azure Kubernetes Service (e.g. using ARM templates, CLI)
- create deployment file for publishing to Azure Kubernetes Service (e.g. kubectl, Helm)
- develop a scaling plan

## Implement infrastructure compliance and security

- implement compliance and security scanning
- prevent drift by using configuration management tools
- automate configuration management by using PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)
- automate configuration management by using a VM Agent with custom script extensions
- set up an automated pipeline to inspect security and compliance
